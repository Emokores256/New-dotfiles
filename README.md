# New-dotfiles - Neovim Config

Welcome to my personal Neovim configuration, crafted for speed, clarity, modularity, and most of all, minimalism. This setup is inspired by 
[Mr Jakob's Neovim playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1gyYttzxcI&list=PLy68Uc77sURrNMN12XR1h58m674KOvLG), with several custom tweaks to suit my workflow and preferences.

- 🧠 **Base Inspiration**: Borrowed ideas from [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) for a clean and minimal starting point.
- 🎨 **Theme**: Kanagawa is my default colorscheme — elegant and easy on the eyes. Feel free to swap it out for your favorite.
- 🔌 **Plugins**: All extensions are organized under `lua/extensions` for easy navigation and modular loading.
- ⚙️ **Modularity**: Designed with reproducibility in mind—each plugin and setting is isolated for clarity and ease of debugging.
- 🧪 **Tweaks & Experiments**: Includes personal adjustments for LSP (managed using [Mason.nvim](https://github.com/mason-org/mason.nvim) and [blink-cmp](https://github.com/saghen/blink.cmp)), 
    formatting using ([Conform.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim)), and UI enhancements using [Snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim).
- 📦 **Plugin Manager**: Uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for efficient plugin loading and performance.
- 🛠️ **Setup**: Works well across Linux environments (tested on Fedora), with CLI-first ergonomics and desktop compatibility.

This config is a living setup — tuned for productivity, but always open to improvement. Feel free to try it for yourself, and improve it to your taste. Just don't make it VS Code! ;)
